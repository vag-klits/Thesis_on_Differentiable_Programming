# Thesis_on_Differentiable_Programming
A differentiation tool based on PyTorch's Autograd

This project is part of my thesis. It's a differentiation tool based on PyTorch's Autograd. The whole code is in struct_and_math_functions.py, differentiation_rules.py and grad.py. The rest of the files are some easy examples for some basic functions. The goal of this project is finding the derivative of a function ('fun') with respect to a specified variable with given values for every variable. User can compose his own 'fun' with the math functions from struct_and_math_functions.py and Python's operators.

Although there is a full documentation for this tool in greek (Thesis.pdf), an english version is on process.
